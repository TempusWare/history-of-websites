When using any of the assets on this website, you are agreeing to these terms:

Credit is necessary.
Acceptable Credit is explicitly stating who made the asset used in the description/post/credits, and linking back to the creator's preferred choice of either their social media profile or YouTube channel.

Example:
Tardis Model made by TempusWare
http://www.youtube.com/tempusware

Please do not forward people to the direct download link or upload the file for them to download.
If you want to share an asset from this website to anyone, please direct them to http://tempusware.co.uk rather than the direct file link. This is so that they read these terms.
Don't just upload the whole asset(if it's a video file or a model) unless it's being used for a purpose that isn't just showing it off. It's pointless, and annoying.
